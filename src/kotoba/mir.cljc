  DEMOTED the pair, arguing that under pressure the extra capacity was worth
  the saves; the hardware counters refuted that (iteration 48: kernel_deep
  retires at IPC 5.74 -- the retire width is the wall, and every value parked
  in RAX/RDX buys its residency with four stack operations per quotient it
  crosses, where a spill slot pays two moves once). Under exclusion the

  This allocator walks one flat instruction list that contains labels and

  the reload lands in the other. A store left there writes a slot on a path that
  was not taken, and the other path reads whatever was in it. A definition
  dominates every use of its value, because the program is in SSA form, so a
  store placed there is executed before any reload of it can be reached.

  "Linear-scan allocation. The pool grows on demand; when it is empty the
  live value with the furthest next use is stored, not every SSA value.
  A body that fits never reaches the spill step, so its assignment is
  byte-for-byte what it was.

  A function that contains a call is offered the non-leaf pool (scratch then
  preserved, no leaf-tier caller-saved). Values live across a call prefer the
  preserved tier at their definition so a call does not have to move them.
  Remaining live caller-saved values are stored at their definition -- the
  store dominates every reload, including the arm that does not contain the
  call -- then dropped from the assignment. A reload in one arm does not
  satisfy a use in another: at every label after the entry, backed values
  that are currently assigned leave the assignment so the next use in that
  block loads them again. The call itself uses the ABI registers. Pressure
  that still cannot complete falls out as :spill-required."

  The admitted CFG has one latch branch, one base return, one body label and
  one terminal self tail-call.  Its counter is an entry argument tested
  directly for nonzero and the corresponding recur argument is exactly
  `counter - 1`.  The remaining body is closed, pure and nontrapping.

  This proves the iteration count for a non-negative runtime counter.  A

  function does not authorize wrapping a negative value into a bulk charge."
