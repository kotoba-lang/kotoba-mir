  "The portable slice of MIR on nbb -- the JDK-free compiler host.

   nbb --classpath \"src:test:$(clojure -Spath -M:test)\" run-tests.cljs

   This repository had only `clojure -M:test` until 2026-09-08. Selection is
   shared by both compiler fronts, and the half that was never run silently
   dropped a fusion for every literal that came from the reader, because a
   guest i64 is a JavaScript BigInt there and `(zero? (js/BigInt 0))` is
   false.

   Namespaces listed here must be `.cljc`, and they must all be RUN: listing
   one and running another is how such a list quietly stops meaning what it
   says."
