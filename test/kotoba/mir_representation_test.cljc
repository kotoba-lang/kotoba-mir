  "Selection must depend on the VALUE of a KIR literal, not on how the host
  happens to represent it.

  This repository had only `clojure -M:test` until 2026-09-08, and on the JVM
  a guest i64 is a Long, so every existing fusion test wrote its constant as
  `0` and every one of them passed. On ClojureScript a guest i64 read back
  from source or from an artifact is a JavaScript BigInt, `(zero? (js/BigInt
  0))` is FALSE, and `aarch64-fuse-zero-equality-branches` therefore never
  fired for a literal that came from the reader -- which is every literal in
  real source. It fired only for the ones the frontend synthesizes.

  Measured 2026-09-08 through amu on nbb before the fix: `(if (= a 0) a a)`
  compiled to 24 bytes of AArch64 where the JVM compiled 12.

  The missed optimization is the smaller half. `kotoba-verifier` re-derives
  the instruction stream from sealed KIR and refuses any drift, so emission
  that is not a function of the KIR value makes artifacts unverifiable: once
  `amu extract-native` started reading artifacts with a reader that preserves
  i64 exactly, a closure-bearing artifact was refused as \"native instruction
  stream rejected\" -- correctly, by a verifier that cannot tell its caller's
  representation from a tampered artifact."
